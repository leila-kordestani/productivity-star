This program is designed to be a study tool, inspired by Coursera's
'Learning How to Learn' MOOC. It integrates proven study hacks like Pomodoros,
interleaving (i.e. studying many different topics within the same study
session), and focused/diffuse modes of learning.

The random selection of tasks in this program eliminates the temptation to
procrastinate. It has been found that once you start on a dreaded task, the
amount of pain and fear tied to that task quickly decreases.

In addition, by studying vastly different topics in the same session your brain
becomes accustomed to jumping around and becomes more flexible, in both its
ability for recall and for coming up with creative solutions.

Use your favorite Pomodoro timer app and don't forget to stop working during
the breaks to let your diffuse learning mode kick in.

***** Good luck! Happy Studying! *****
